== yasli - C++ serialization ==

=== Motivation ===

Serialization is an important tool of software development. Unfortunately 
standard C++ library provides very scarce means for serialization, such as
standard I/O-streams. 

yasli was born as a tool for data-driven game development. It allowed
programmer to rapidly define data structures and expose their content to game
designers.

With the time it gather number of properties that make it valueable outside
of initial domain:

- Concise and easy to define serialization procedures
- Abstract archives decouple user serialization code from specific format
implementation
- Multiple formats supported:
	* JSON
	* BinArchive - compact hash-based binary stream
	* QPropertyTree - a flexible UI for interctive editing of the serialized data
- Decent performance
- Ability to change format with time

=== Installation ===

==== Supported compilers ====

yasli (except for QPropertyTree) is known to work on following platforms:

- Windows, MSVC 2005-2013 (x86/x64)
- Linux, x86/x64, clang/gcc
- various Android versions, clang/gcc (arm)
- iOS, XCode (arm, arm64)
- OS X, XCode x86/x64
- Emscripten (C++ to JavaScript compiler)

yasli is written in portable C++ and compiling it on a new platform is
relatively straightforward.

QPropertyTree requires Qt5 to work and compiles on following platforms:

- Windows, MSVC 2005-2013 (x86/x64)
- Linux, x86/x64, clang/gcc
- OS X, x86/x64

==== Downloading source code ====

yasli source code is available on bitbucket:
https://bitbucket.org/admix/yasli

Source code is stored using http://mercurial.selenic.com/[Mercurial] version
control system. You can obtain it using
http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/[TortoiseHg] - wonderful GUI client for
Mercurial, available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

Alternatively you can obtain source code using command line:
[source,bash]
----
hg clone https://admix@bitbucket.org/admix/yasli
----

==== Adding yasli to your project ====
yasli is using http://cmake.org[CMake] for its project files. CMake is a
project files generator that support variety of different platforms.

===== CMake =====
If your project happens to use CMake as well adding yasli to project should
be quite straightforward:
[source,cmake]
----
add_subdirectory(yasli/yasli)
target_link_libraries(my_application yasli)

add_subdirectory(yasli/QPropertyTree)
target_link_libraries(my_qt_application QPropertyTree)
----

===== Visual Studio =====
If you are using Visual Studio you can include yasli to your project by referencing
yasli/yasli.vcxproj (or yasli/yasli.vcproj for older versions).

===== Including source files directly =====

Alternatively, for core functionality you can include source files from
yasli folder into your project. To QPropertyTree you can include files from 
QPropertyTree folder.

=== Usage ===

yasli structured in a moduler way, and often different features require
different headers. If you feel like adding same headers in your code starts
beign repetitive, you may create own Serialization.h-header with commonly used
features, for example:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <yasli/Archive.h>
#include <yasli/STL.h>
#include <yasli/Enum.h>
#include <yasli/ClassFactory.h>
----

Rest of the section will describe each of those in details.

==== Serialization method ====

The easiest way to get started with yasli is to add serialize() method to your types.
For example:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <yasli/Archive.h>

struct MyType
{
	int field_a;
	float field_b;
	bool field_c;

	void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
	{
		ar(field_a, "field_a", "Field A");
		ar(field_b, "field_b", "Field B");
		ar(field_c, "field_c", "Field C");
	}
};
----

Same approach works for nested structures/class instances, normally each nested
structure would receive each own "block", depending on the archive type. For
example, for JSON that would be a new level of dictionary/map.

NOTE: You may wonder why third why third parameter is needed: this defines a
label, a human readable text for the data element that can be used with
<<QPropertyTree>>. If you have no plans of editing your data through UI it can
be omitted.

==== STL containers and strings ====

yasli supports serialization of following STL types out of the box:

- std::string
- std::wstring
- std::vector
- std::list
- std::map
- std::pair

To be able to serialize one of these, you will need to include one more header:
[source,cpp]
----
#include <yasli/STL.h>
----

Now you can serialize instances of these types in the same way as standard
types. Containers can contain both primitive types, structures, or even other
containers.

==== Enumerations ====

yasli is able to serialize variables of enumeration types, but requires user to
register names for specific enumeration values. 

After 

Example of enum registration:

[source,cpp]
----
// header
enum Shape
{
	SHAPE_CIRCLE,
	SHAPE_ROUND_RECTANGLE,
	SHAPE_RECTANGLE
};

class MyClass
{
public:
	enum NestedEnum
	{
		NESTED_VALUE1,
		NESTED_VALUE2
	};
};

// implementation file
#include <yasli/Enum.h>

YASLI_ENUM_BEGIN(Shape, "Shape")
YASLI_ENUM(SHAPE_CIRCLE, "circle", "Circle")
YASLI_ENUM(SHAPE_ROUND_RECTANGLE, "round_rectangle", "Round Rectangle")
YASLI_ENUM(SHAPE_RECTANGLE, "shape_rectangle", "Rectangle")
YASLI_ENUM_END()

YASLI_ENUM_BEGIN_NESTED(MyClass, NestedEnum, "Nested Enumeration")
YASLI_ENUM(MyClass::NESTED_VALUE1, "nested_value1", "Nested Value 1")
YASLI_ENUM(MyClass::NESTED_VALUE2, "nested_value2", "Nested Value 2")
YASLI_ENUM_END()
----

WARNING: To prevent double registration YASLI_ENUM_* macros should be placed 
within implementation file, instead of keeping them in the header.

==== Polymorphic types ====
yasli has notion of polymorphic types, such types can be serialized by
serializing smart pointers pointing to the base type. Example of such pointer
is provided in yasli/Pointers.h, you can follow it to implement serialization
of your own pointers.

To be deserialized propertly each derived type should be registered in
yasli::ClassFactory:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <yasli/Pointers.h>
#include <yasli/ClassFactory.h>

#include <string>
#include <stdio.h>


struct IAction
{
	virtual ~IAction() {}
	virtual void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar) = 0;
	virtual void execute() {}
};

struct MessageAction : IAction
{
	std::string text;

	void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
	{
		ar(text, "text", "Text");
	}
};
YASLI_CLASS_NAME(IAction, MessageAction, "message", "Message")

struct ActionUser
{
	yasli::SharedPtr<IAction> action;

	void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
	{
		ar(action, "action", "Action");
	}
};
----

==== Non-intrusive serialization ====
It is often usefull to be able to serialize types without modifying them, this
could happen for number of reasons, for example:

- When using types from Standard Template Library types
- When using third party code
- When extra dependencies are not desirable in type definitions

For such cases yasli provides additional serialize function, this one is global overloaded function:

[source,cpp]
----
bool serialize(yasli::Archive& ar, UserType& instance, const char* name, const char* label);
----
UserType should be replaced with a type, that you want to be serialized.

Such external serialize function is different from serialize method in number of ways:

- It doesn't add additional level of nesting. In practice that means that you
would serialize only one object or field and use supplied name and label. This
object however can implement serialzation for the user type.
- Function returns bool, it tells whatever the value was read from the archive. Usually
this is just a return value of nested ar() call.

Here is a simple example for a little wrapper that wraps integer.

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyId
{
	int value;
};

bool serialize(yasli::Archive& ar, MyId& id, const char* name, const char* label)
{
	return ar(id.value, name, label);
};
----
Note that you don't need to call this function directly, you can call serialization in a usual way:

[source,cpp]
----
struct MyType
{
	MyId id;
	void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
	{
		ar(id, "id", "Id");
	}
}
----
Consistent way of calling serialization gives you flexibility to change the
serialization logic of a specific type without breaking its users.

Here is another example, where you would serialize a structure with nested fields:

[source,cpp]
----
struct Vector3
{
	float x, y, z;
};

// possibly, in other header:
bool serialize(yasli::Archive&, Vector3& v, const char* name, const char* label);

// implementation
struct Vector3Serializer
{
	Vector3& v;
	Vector3Serializer(Vector3& v) : v(v) {}

	bool serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
	{
		ar(v.x, "x", "X");
		ar(v.y, "y", "Y");
		ar(v.z, "z", "Z");
	}
};

bool serialize(yasli::Archive&, Vector3& v, const char* name, const char* label)
{
	Vector3Serializer serializer(v);
	return ar(serializer, name, label);
}

----

WARNING: Note that due to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument-dependent_name_lookup[Argument Dependent
name Lookup] (or Koenig-lookup) global serialize function has to be placed into
the same namespace as serialized type.

==== Conversion and versioning ====
Although yasli doesn't provide direct support for versioning of the data it
provides tools that allows you to implement it easily on top of existing
functionality.

===== Conversion based on field names =====
First proposed technique to maintain multiple versions of data
relies on naming of the fields, and ability to check if specific field
was read. A brief example:

[source,cpp]
----
struct EternalType
{
	// version 1 used one string to store a reference
	// std::string reference;

	// version 2 switched to a vector of strings
	// std::vector<std::string> references;

	// version 3 switch to an array of structures
	struct Reference
	{
		bool import = false;
		string filename;

		void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
		{
			ar(filename, "filename");
			ar(preload, "preload");
		}
	};
	std::vector<Reference> imports;

	void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
	{
		if(!ar(imports, "imports"))
		{
			// "references" were not loaded, let's try to read old formats
			string reference_v1;
			vector<string> references_v2;

			if (ar(references_v2, "references"))
			{
				imports.clear();
				imports.resize(references_v2.size());
				for (size_t i = 0; i < references_v2.size(); ++i)
				{
					imports[i].filename = references_v2[i];
					imports[i].preload = false;
				}
			}
			else if (ar(reference_v1, "reference"))
			{
				imports.clear();
				Reference r;
				r.filename = reference_v1;
				imports.push_back(r);
			}
		}
	}
};
----
NOTE: Ability to serialize/deserialize variables created on the stack makes
it possible to do a variety of data conversions on the fly.

===== Explicit versioning =====

Below is a similar example that uses explicit versioning to perform data
conversion.

[source,cpp]
----
struct EternalType
{
	enum { ACTUAL_VERSION = 3 };

	// version 1 used one string to store a reference
	// std::string reference;

	// version 2 switched to a vector of strings
	// std::vector<std::string> references;

	// version 3 switch to an array of structures
	struct Reference
	{
		bool preload = false;
		string filename;

		void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
		{
			ar(filename, "filename");
			ar(preload, "preload");
		}
	};
	std::vector<Reference> imports;

	void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
	{
		int version = ACTUAL_VERSION;
		if (!ar(version, "version"))
			version = 0;

		switch(version) 
		{
		case 0:
		{
			// handle missing/broke data
			break;
		}
		case 1:
		{
			string reference;
			ar(reference, "reference");
			imports.clear();
			Reference r;
			r.filename = reference;
			imports.push_back(r);
			break;
		}
		case 2:
		{
			vector<string> references;
			imports.resize(references.size());
			for (size_t i = 0; i < references.size(); ++i)
			{
				imports[i].filename = references[i];
				imports[i].preload = false;
			}
			break;
		}
		case ACTUAL_VERSION:
		{
			ar(imports, "imports");
			break;
		}
		default:
		{
			// handle unsupported version
			break;
		}
		};
	}
};
----
As you see with minimal effort you get full control over data loading and
conversion process.

=== QPropertyTree ===

QPropertyTree is a powerful property grid. Among its features:

* Easy creation of properties through serialization.
* Enumerations presented as drop-down menus
* Editing of containers and polymorphic types
* Drag & drop
* Copy & paste
* Automatic undo
* Can be extended to have custom UI for specific user types.
* Value decorators provide annotations to data fields, like:
	- Ranges for numbers
	- Filetered file selection
	- Unit conversion, i.e. edit radians as degrees or quaternions as euler
	  angles.
* Additional control characters provide basic control over layout and
  attributes of the properties, such as:
	- Inlining of properties
	- Control of property alignment and width
	- Read-only properties
	- Hidden properties (allows to transfer additional data during copy&paste
	  or drag&drop).

==== Basic usage ====

QProprtyTree is a regular Qt widget. Usually such widget is instantiated on
heap through "new" call.

The only way to populate QPropertyTree is by attached serializable object.

[source,cpp]
----
#include <QPropertyTree/QPropertyTree.h>
#include <yasli/Serializer.h>

struct MyType
{
	bool testOption = false;

	void serialize(yasli::Archive& ar)
	{
		ar(testOption, "testOption", "Test Option");
	}
};

MyType instance;

QPropertyTree* propertyTree = new QPropertyTree(this);
propertyTree->attach(yasli::Serializer(instance));

----

Such property tree should display one checkbox label "Test Option".

WARNING: Note that tree stores reference to attached object and user of the
QPropertyTree is responsible for maintaining its lifetime and calling
QPropertyTree::detach() in case attached object seizes to exist.

QPropertyTree uses third argument to Archive::operator() call to specify
label, text that appears next to the value.

How does the tree update apply changes to attached instance? It calls
serialization each time user changes data. It does it twice: once to read
fields of instance from properties, and then it writes properties back.
At may appear wasteful at first, but in practice this procedure is quite fast.
You can serialize hundreads of thousands of properties and still have
interactive update speeds. Such approach gimes some interesting qualities to
the PropertyTree:

* Set of serialized parameters can be changed dynamically, i.e. serialize
  function can contain conditions that would present only relevant
  parameters. 
* As QPropertyTree stores only to top-level reference to attached object there
  are no limitations to lifetime of individual fieldsl. They can be constructed
  on the stack and this opens door for all kind of conversion and
  data transformations in a concise and localized faschion.
* Validation and clamping of values can be peformed during serialization and
  user will be able to observe it in interactive way.

Below is description of main QPropertyTree methods:

==== QPropertyTree methods ====

attach(yasli::Serializer&)::
	Used to populate tree with properties of serializable object.

detach()::
	Disconnects object from the tree and clears properties.
	
revert()::
	Updates property tree by writing fields of attached object over again.
	You can use this function once attached object changed and you want to 
	update content of the tree to reflect the changes.

apply()::
	Force to read fields of object from properties. May be used to rollback
	state of attached object to the last property tree state.

setExpandLevels(int levels)::
	Specifies how deep tree should be expanded by default. To take effect
	this function should be called _before call to attach()_.

==== Decorators (annotations) ====

yasli provides following decorators that can be used to annotate your data
for QPropertyTree.

===== Range =====
Provides a range for numbers and makes them behave like sliders:
[source,cpp]
----
#include <yasli/decorators/Range.h>

ar(yasli::Range(floatValue, 0.0f, 100.0f), "floatValue", "Float Value");
----

===== BitFlags =====
Display individual bits of an integer as checkboxes. Names for individual
bits are registered the same way as <<Enumerations>>.
[source,cpp]
----
#include <yasli/decorators/BitFlags.h>

enum AxisMask
{
	X_AXIS_BIT = 1 << 0,
	Y_AXIS_BIT = 1 << 1,
	Z_AXIS_BIT = 1 << 2
};

YASLI_ENUM_BEGIN(AxisMask, "Axis Mask")
YASLI_ENUM(X_AXIS_BIT, "x", "X Axis")
YASLI_ENUM(Y_AXIS_BIT, "y", "Y Axis")
YASLI_ENUM(Z_AXIS_BIT, "z", "Z Axis")
YASLI_ENUM_END()

int axisMask = X_AXIS_BIT | Y_AXIS_BIT;
ar(yasli::BitFlags<AxisMask>(axisMask), "axisMask", "Axis Mask");
----

==== Control characters (layout) ====
PropertyTree supports some simple layout control, this is implemented through
special characters that that can be embedded into the label. Sounds scary? It
is quite practilal though. Some simple example:
[source,cpp]
----
ar(value, "value", "!<Value");
----

This value will appear as read-only and expanded field. See below for
descriptions of specific control characters.

inline (^)::
	Used to bring multiple children properties on one line.
	For example, often it is useful to have X,Y and Z components of the vector to
	appear next to each other, rather than each on a separate line. It can be
	serialized in a following way then:
[source,cpp]
----
struct Vector3
{
	float x, y, z;

	void serialize(Archive& ar)
	{
		ar(x, "x", "^X");
		ar(y, "y", "^Y");
		ar(z, "z", "^Z");
	}
};
----

read-only (!)::
Read only fields can not be changed by the user. 

expand (<)::
Value of expanded field will occupy the all available space. Useful for
parameters that are known to have longer text than most of other parameters,
i.e. file paths, or long text fields.

contract (>)::
Value field is contracted to minimal size. Useful for limiting parameters
size, when serializing tables of data.

==== Editing multiple objects at the same time ====
